# digit_recognisation





This project includes two models—a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—that detect and classify digits drawn by the user on a webcam feed. Trained using the MNIST digits dataset, which includes thousands of handwritten digit images (0-9), the models are designed to identify and recognize digits in real-time.

This setup allows users to draw digits on-screen, with the model instantly recognizing and displaying the detected number, making it ideal for interactive digit recognition applications.
